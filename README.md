# Description
Deep learning is evolving at a rapid pace with new algorithms released on almost daily basis. While some authors make their code open source, making it easier for implementation, however the code is often very messy and hard to re-implement. My aim in this repository is to provide beginners friendly approach towards coding some of the cutting-edge concepts in deep learning. Their is an associated [Medium](https://medium.com/@naveed88375) account with these code materials, where I provide in-depth explanations for the codes and associated tasks. Feel free to re-use this code and modify for your own tasks.
